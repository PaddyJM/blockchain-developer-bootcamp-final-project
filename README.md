## project idea

Trade NFTs that prove ownership of shares/stocks.

## example workflow

1. user mints a token for their share
2. the token is a proof that the user own the share by identifying them (e.g. user personal details etc)
3. user sells token to another user
4. transaction serves as cryptographic proof that ownership has been transferred

Note: in order to meet Anti-Money Laundering regulations it is necessary to identify the owner of the shares
