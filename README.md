## project idea

Trade NFTs that prove ownership of shares/stocks.

## example workflow

1. user mints a token for their share
2. the token is a proof that the user owns the share (possibly by using a digital identity)
3. user sells token to another user
4. transaction serves as cryptographic proof that ownership has been transferred

Note: in order to meet Anti-Money Laundering regulations it is necessary to identify the owner of the shares
